# Steamed Minty Decks
## Linux Mint Setup Guide for the Valve Steam Deck

## This guide assumes you are using the same version of Linux Mint as I am, and are having the same issues. xD
Linux Mint 22 - Cinnamon Edition

### Current Known Issues:
- Rotated Login Screen when booting and logging out. (I must currently login using a docking station.)
- No TDP Control. (Important for saving battery while using the device undocked.)
- No Gamescope (SteamOS Gaming Mode).
- ???

### These are the goals of this guide:
- Fix the issues above.
- Add additional guides as needed for certain apps/games.

### Why Linux Mint?
- Linux Mint is easy to use and it's pretty stable for everday normal use. My Steam Deck is not going to be used just for gaming, but likely as my main PC with a docking station, keyboard and mouse, and an external monitor.
- I like the Cinnamon Desktop Environment. It's more customizable out of the box than Gnome, while being less buggy than KDE. It also looks sleek and modern, with a similar workflow to Windows.
- I hate immutable distros. Why? Making changes to the system files on most immutable distros is more difficult, as such installing drivers for certain hardware and peripherals can be an issue.
- I like native system packages! Flatpak is great, except for it having worse performance... and being much more bloated than regular, native system packages. I have limited space (the Steam Deck only accepts a single M.2 2230 SSD, and a single microSD slot).  I also have slow, rural DSL internet (3 mbps in 2025 - Brightspeed, F*ck You!).
