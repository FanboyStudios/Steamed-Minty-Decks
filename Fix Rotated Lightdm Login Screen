1. Open the /etc/lightdm/ folder as root in your file browser.

2. Open the lightdm.conf file with your text editor.

3. In the "[Seat:*]" section add the following on a new line:
greeter-setup-script=/etc/lightdm/greeter_setup.sh

4. Save the file and close the text editor.

5. Create a "greeter_setup.sh" file (without quotation marks) in the same folder with the following content.
#!/bin/bash
xrandr -o right
xinput --map-to-output 'pointer:FTS3528:00 2808:1015' eDP
exit 0

6. Save the file and close the text editor.

7. Right click on the file. Open the properties menu, go to the "Permmisions" tab and check the box for "Allow exceuting file as program".

8. Reboot your Steam Deck. The Login Screen should now appear correctly. 
- The touchscreen interaction layer is still rotated though. (Looking for a fix...)

9. ???
