How To Change WiFi Power Saving Mode!

By default, WiFi Powersave Mode is enabled in Linux Mint. 

This may cause issues with downloads going slow. This can also lead to downloads stopping/failing when the device suspends, as such some of you might want to change this setting.



1. Open the /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d folder as root in your file browser.

2. Open the default-wifi-powersave-on.conf file with your text editor.

3. In the "[connection]" section change the number in "wifi.powersave = 3" your desired value (2 disables powersave, 3 enables powersave). 

4. Save the file and close the text editor.

5. Open yout terminal and enter the following command to restart your network manager and apply your changes:
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager

6. Profit?
